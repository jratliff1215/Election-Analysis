# Overview of Colorado Election Audit

The Election Commission has requested a validation of the election results using Python. The analysis includes voter turnout by county the percent of votes from each county (based on total votes), and the county with the highest voter turnout. Python allows for accurate reporting of this information to the election commission. If successful, the Election Commission will use a similar method for other election result reporting.
