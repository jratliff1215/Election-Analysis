# Overview of Colorado Election Audit

The Election Commission has requested a validation of the election results using Python. The analysis includes voter turnout by county the percent of votes from each county (based on total votes), and the county with the highest voter turnout. Python allows for accurate reporting of this information to the election commission. If successful, the Election Commission will use a similar method for other election result reporting.

# Election Audit Summary
  
For future elections, the Python script can be modified to fit any election and audit the results. The fastest method to modify our script would be to change the file path. If a CSV file is compiled for each election, the user would modify the following section to link the file to the script.

In a deeper analysis, votes for each candidate by county could be added to the script. This may show anomalies in the popularity of a candidate by county. For example, Charles Casper Stockham received the popular vote in Jefferson County, with 19,723 votes compared to the overall winner (Diana DeGette) with only 17,963. This information could be used by each candidate to show where their campaign was successful and where additional campaigning may be necessary in future elections.
